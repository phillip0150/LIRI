# LIRI
In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the README.md file should meet the following criteria:
Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
Clearly list the technologies used in the app
State your role in the app development
Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
If you haven't written a markdown file yet, click here for a rundown, or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.



Ever wish you could type to siri? Well now you can with LIRI. LIRI is a *Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface*. What LIRI can do is give you search results based on a command. LIRI can search spotify songs, search events that an artist is performing at, search for a movie, and finally answering commands in a text file. 


I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
